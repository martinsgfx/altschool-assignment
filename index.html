      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Martins Akinnuwesi, and I'm a proud son of Ondo State, Nigeria,
        currently living in the bustling city of Lagos. I have always been
        passionate about technology and the arts. I studied Computer Engineering
        Technology, and while I've always loved working with computers, my true
        creative outlet has been through art and drawing. During my NYSC year, I
        discovered a passion for digital design, learning how to use Photoshop
        to bring my ideas to life. That year sparked a journey that has lasted
        over seven years, and I'm still designing, creating, and loving every
        minute of it. I’ve also always been fascinated by front-end development,
        but for the longest time, I struggled to learn it on my own. No matter
        how hard I tried, I just couldn’t crack the code—literally! <br />
        <br />
        Eventually, I found a new direction with AltSchool, and I’m now on a
        path to finally mastering those elusive front-end skills. When I'm not
        immersed in design or coding, I love listening to music; it's the
        perfect backdrop for my creative work. I'm also a big fan of video
        games—they offer me a fun escape from the daily hustle. I come from a
        loving family with two sisters and two brothers who inspire me every
        day. My journey has been filled with twists and turns, but I’m driven by
        my passion for both technology and art, and I can’t wait to see where it
        takes me next!
